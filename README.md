# Sonar Rock vs Mine Detection using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning techniques to classify sonar signals as either **rocks** or **mines** based on frequency-based sonar return data. By training on the widely-used **Sonar dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository**, the model learns to detect subtle patterns in the signal data to make accurate binary classifications.

The goal is to demonstrate how supervised learning algorithms can be applied to real-world problems in **defense and marine safety**.
